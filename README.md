# Nicotine+ - Leech No More (Plugin)
The Leech No More plugin is based on Leech Detector and adds an option to ban users that share zero file (aka 'Turboleechers').

Installation instructions:
- Simply copy the 'leech_nomore' folder into your Nicotine+ 'plugins' folder (./Nicotine+/lib/pynicotine/plugins)

Improvements to be made in future versions:
- [ ] Fix the buddy detection return
- [ ] Add settings to request minimum shared files for autoban. This will allow to send a warning to users that share less than 'X' files and ban users that share less than 'Y' files.
