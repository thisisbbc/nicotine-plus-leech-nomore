# Nicotine+ â€“ Leech No More (Plugin)
The Leech No More plugin is based on Leech Detector and adds an option to ban users that share zero file (aka 'Turboleechers').

Installation instructions:
- Simply copy the 'leech_nomore' folder into your Nicotine+ 'plugins' folder (./Nicotine+/lib/pynicotine/plugins)

Tested to be compatible with Nicotine+ v3.3.x

Improvements to be made in future versions:
- [ ] Add "Minimum Files Shared" requirement for autoban (currently only bans users with zero file shared)
